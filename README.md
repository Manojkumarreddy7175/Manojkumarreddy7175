## 👨‍💻 About Me

Developer by day, problem-solver by nature. I'm that person who sees a clunky process and thinks *"I can build something better"* — then actually does it.

I specialize in **full-stack development** with **⚛️ React**, **🐍 Python**, and **💾 SQL** — creating applications that are as robust under the hood as they are polished on the surface.

Currently helping companies build smarter applications through AI integration and thoughtful UX. Based in **📍 India**, working globally.
```javascript

    currentFocus: "Building intelligent web applications",
    interests: ["AI/ML", "Full-Stack Development", "Clean Architecture"],
    approach: "Ship fast, iterate faster",
    status: "Open to opportunities"
};
